# Intro to Tidyquant

Today we will be using the Tidyquant package in R to collect financial data, create a portfolio, and visualize our portfolio. First, let's install and load our libraries:

```{r include = FALSE}
library(tidyquant)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

1a) To get the index options, use "tq_index_options()", and "tq_exchange_options()", which will give you a list of options for each.

```{r}
tq_index_options()
tq_exchange_options()

```
